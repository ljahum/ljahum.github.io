## Introduction (TL;DR)

> Authenticated encryption (AE) is a term used to describe encryption systems  that simultaneously protect confidentiality and authenticity (integrity) of  communications; that is, AE provides both message encryption and message  authentication of a plaintext block or message .

The offset codebook block cipher mode (OCB)

OCB provide an extremely efficient  algorithm, equal to or more efficient than other AE algorithms. OCB is a cipher mode and we can apply ocb to AES/DES/SM4 etc.



The following paragraph briefly introduces OCB1 and OCB2

## OCB1

Figure 1 shows the overall structure for OCB encryption and authentication.

The message M to be  encrypted and authenticated is divided into n-bit blocks, with the exception  of the last block, which may be less than n bits. Typically, n = 128.
